This application uses Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) to make the machine learning model available to users.

 This idea assignment also came from Michael Colbert's Digital Product Management class. Colbert adapted to a data science salary prediction model and Microsoft Azure for purposes of teaching, and I am a student using his content to learn new skills.

### What I learned During this Assignment

---

1. In this assignment I learned more about using stylesheet.css pages, as well as about bootstrap style formatting.

2. Part of this assignment was a good reminder for myself in using templates, as I completed the assignment without a partner this time around.

3. Finally, I learned how to go through the deploy codes of GitHub as I was struggling with getting my azure page to load.
